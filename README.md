# Ad Campaign Performance Analysis for EdTech Platform

## Executive Summary:
Marketing campaign efficiency has been declining for our EdTech platform, and we needed to identify underperforming campaigns and cost-saving opportunities. Using Excel, SQL concepts, and data visualization, I analyzed advertising performance data and built dashboards to track impressions, clicks, and conversions across campaigns. After identifying that the largest budget inefficiencies came from campaigns with high CPR and below-average CTR, I recommend the marketing and finance teams take the following actions to improve ROI:

Discontinue low-performing campaigns
Reallocate budget to high-engagement audiences
Refine targeting and ad creative

## Business Problem:
Successful ad campaigns are critical for this EdTech platform because they directly impact user acquisition and marketing spend efficiency. Marketing and finance stakeholders have observed that several campaigns are delivering lower performance than expected (based on impressions and reach versus clicks and unique link clicks). How can we identify where engagement is dropping across campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize spend and improve overall campaign effectiveness?

## Methodology:
An Excel-based workflow that extracts, cleans, and structures marketing campaign data for analysis.
A performance dashboard that tracks impressions, reach, clicks, and conversion metrics by campaign.
A funnel-style analysis to evaluate engagement drop-offs and identify the highest-impact optimization opportunities.

## Skills:
1. Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, lookups, conditional formulas
2. Data Visualization: Dashboard creation, KPI tracking, campaign performance reporting
3. Python: Pandas, basic analysis, metric calculations, funnel-style performance analysis
