# Ad Campaign Performance Analysis for EdTech Platform

## Executive Summary:
Marketing campaign efficiency has been declining for our EdTech platform, and we needed to identify underperforming campaigns and cost-saving opportunities. Using Excel, SQL concepts, and data visualization, I analyzed advertising performance data and built dashboards to track impressions, clicks, and conversions across campaigns. After identifying that the largest budget inefficiencies came from campaigns with high CPR and below-average CTR, I recommend the marketing and finance teams take the following actions to improve ROI:

Discontinue low-performing campaigns
Reallocate budget to high-engagement audiences
Refine targeting and ad creative

## Business Problem:
Successful ad campaigns are critical for this EdTech platform because they directly impact user acquisition and marketing spend efficiency. Marketing and finance stakeholders have observed that several campaigns are delivering lower performance than expected (based on impressions and reach versus clicks and unique link clicks). How can we identify where engagement is dropping across campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize spend and improve overall campaign effectiveness?

## Methodology:
An Excel-based workflow that extracts, cleans, and structures marketing campaign data for analysis.
A performance dashboard that tracks impressions, reach, clicks, and conversion metrics by campaign.
A funnel-style analysis to evaluate engagement drop-offs and identify the highest-impact optimization opportunities.

## Skills:
1. Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, lookups, conditional formulas
2. Data Visualization: Dashboard creation, KPI tracking, campaign performance reporting
3. Python: Pandas, basic analysis, metric calculations, funnel-style performance analysis

## Results & Business Recommendation

Building a dashboard to monitor campaign performance provides marketing and finance stakeholders with clear visibility into the full advertising funnel across all campaigns. By making this data accessible, stakeholders can now self-serve insights, reducing ad hoc requests to the analytics team by around 4–5 hours per week. Analysis showed that nearly 40% of impressions failed to generate clicks, and campaigns with low CTR were driving the largest budget inefficiencies. The Python-based funnel analysis suggests that increasing click-through rates by just 1% for underperforming campaigns could generate approximately $320 more in daily conversions, while reallocating spend to high-engagement audiences could boost overall ROI by an average of 18%.

Because the largest improvements in ROI will likely come from increasing engagement and click-through rates, I recommend the following marketing adjustments:

1. Pause or discontinue low-performing campaigns and reallocate their budgets to high-engagement audiences.
2. Refine ad creative and targeting to better resonate with key user segments.
3. Send follow-up emails or push notifications to users who clicked but did not convert, encouraging them to complete registration or enrollment.
4. Test variations in messaging and visuals to identify what drives higher interaction and conversion rates.

I believe these adjustments will address the biggest campaign inefficiencies, increase conversions and revenue, and reduce the time marketing and analytics teams spend on manual reporting.

## Next Steps:
AB Test copy within the workflow
Train clients and users
Measure email and text open & click rates
